Based on code from:
    The Rasterman        <raster@redhat.com>
    Michael Fulbright    <msf@redhat.com>

Spectragram (originally called "tape") submitted by:
    Gregor Leusch <gleusch@Pool.Informatik.RWTH-Aachen.DE>

and hacked by Dave J. Andruczyk to be fully scalable...

Thanks goes out to Andy Lo A Foe who created Alsaplayer for his excellent
advice on autoconf, and helping me streamline the configure process.

Thanks to Rolf Mueller, for helping me extensively with the window
functions section, and the color picker parts.

Thanks to Ralph Loader <suckfish@ihug.co.nz> for the convolve pattern
matching routines making the scope INCREDIBLY stable, even at low freqs.

Thanks to Eric Lassauge for the patches to the Colormap code 
and fixes here and there....

Thanks to Paritosh Pandy <pandya@tifr.res.in> for assisting with 
testing the decimation code and giving me the push I needed to get 
back into development.
