If  a pointer is declared as a short *
then incrementing it by one actually moves forward in the buffer by
16 bits (1 short)

When malloc'ing a buffer it doesn't matter how you allocate it, you just
have to do it in  bytes,  so make sure you are using the necessary conversions
if you like to think of your data in anything but bytes.  Beware that when
referencing your buffer via a pointer that is not a char *, that each increment
or decrement will move in the buffer by that size of that pointerss TYPE.
if the pointer is a char * you move by 8 bits, if its a short * you move by
16 bits, if its an int * you move by 32 bits. above that varies by platform
 (definitions of long and long long are not the same on intel/alpha/sparce in
 all cases..)
