New Colormap format for eXtace 1.6.2 and higher.
NOTE:  This format is subject to revision and may change in the future.

Idea:
    To have a colormap file that is easily configurable and has at a bare 
    minimum of two colorpoints. (the ends).  eXtace will use linear 
    interpolation between all steps to generate the complete map.
    
Sections and Fields in the colormap file:
    1.  [General] Section
	"steps=" This contains the number of steps in the file
	    Max steps = 50
	"step_x=" Position in the map for step number "x".  "x" starts at "1"
	for the first step, and ends at "steps". Position is a
	percentage varying from 0.0-1.0 (floating-point)
	
    2.  [Colormap] Section
	"{red,green,blue}_x" the red/green/blue value at step number "x"
	That above variables with be in rgb triplets, for all steps.
